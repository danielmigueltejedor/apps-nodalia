configuration:
  setup_profile:
    name: Setup profile
    description: >-
      High-level profile to simplify setup.
      `custom` keeps manual control (current behavior).
      `home_access` applies safe defaults for remote access to Home Assistant.
      `subnet_router` enables route acceptance and (when advertise_routes is empty)
      auto-advertises local subnets.
      `exit_node` enables advertising this node as an exit node.
  accept_dns:
    name: Accept DNS
    description: >-
      If you are experiencing trouble with MagicDNS on this device and wish to
      disable, you can do so using this option.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  accept_routes:
    name: Accept routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to accept subnet routes advertised by other nodes
      in your tailnet.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  advertise_exit_node:
    name: Advertise as an exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise this Tailscale instance as an exit node.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  advertise_connector:
    name: Advertise as an app connector
    description: >-
      When you use an app connector, you specify which applications you wish to make
      accessible over your tailnet, and the domains for those applications. Any traffic
      for that application is then forced over the tailnet to a node running an app
      connector before egressing to the target domains.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  advertise_routes:
    name: Advertise subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows you to advertise routes to subnets (accessible on the network
      your device is connected to) to other clients on your tailnet.
      When not set, no subnet routes are advertised by default.
      With `setup_profile: subnet_router`, empty `advertise_routes` enables local
      subnet auto-detection and advertisement.
  exit_node:
    name: Use exit node
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify another Tailscale instance as an exit node for
      this device.
      By setting a device on your network as an exit node, you can use it to
      route all your public internet traffic as needed, like a consumer VPN.
      This option is unused by default.
  log_level:
    name: Log level
    description: >-
      Controls the level of log details the app provides.
      This only applies to the app itself, not Tailscale.
  login_server:
    name: Login server
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify a custom control server for this
      Tailscale instance, for example, a self-host Headscale instance.
      By default, it uses the control server provided by Tailscale.
  share_homeassistant:
    name: Share Home Assistant with Serve or Funnel
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Tailscale Serve or Funnel features to present
      your Home Assistant instance with a valid certificate on your tailnet or on the
      internet.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  share_on_port:
    name: Share on port
    description: >-
      This option lets you specify which port the Tailscale Serve and Funnel features
      will use to present your Home Assistant instance on the tailnet and on the
      internet.
      Only ports 443, 8443, and 10000 are allowed by Tailscale.
      When not set, port 443 is used by default.
  snat_subnet_routes:
    name: Source NAT subnet routes
    description: >-
      This option allows subnet devices to see the traffic originating from the
      subnet router, and this simplifies routing configuration.
      To support advanced Site-to-site networking (eg. to traverse multiple
      networks), you can disable this functionality.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  stateful_filtering:
    name: Stateful packet filtering
    description: >-
      This option enables stateful packet filtering on packet-forwarding nodes (exit
      nodes, subnet routers, and app connectors), to only allow return packets for
      existing outbound connections.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  tags:
    name: Tags
    description: >-
      This option allows you to specify specific ACL tags for this
      Tailscale instance. They need to start with `tag:`.
  taildrop:
    name: Taildrop
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable Taildrop, a file sharing service
      that allows you to share files with other Tailscale nodes.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  userspace_networking:
    name: Userspace networking mode
    description: >-
      This option allows you to enable userspace networking mode.
      If you need to access other clients on your tailnet from your Home
      Assistant instance, disable userspace networking mode, which will create a
      `tailscale0` network interface on your host.
      When not set, this option is disabled by default.
  webui_readonly:
    name: Web UI readonly mode
    description: >-
      Enables readonly mode for the embedded Tailscale Web UI.
      Keep this enabled for safer operation.
      Disable it only if you need full tailnet actions in the Web UI.
      The onboarding panel keeps local machine controls (logout/reconnect) in readonly mode.
      When not set, this option is enabled by default.
  external_apps_compat_options:
    name: External apps compatibility (optional)
    description: >-
      Compatibility mode for setups that share legacy
      configuration values with other apps.
      Keep disabled unless you explicitly need it.
  support_tunnel_enabled:
    name: Support access button
    description: >-
      Enables temporary support access controls in onboarding.
      Support access can be enabled only when this node matches
      the configured support tailnet DNS suffix.
  support_tailnet_dns_suffix:
    name: Support tailnet DNS suffix
    description: >-
      DNS suffix used to validate support access (for example `tail37b857.ts.net`).
      Support access is enabled only when this node DNS matches that suffix.
  support_user:
    name: Support local user
    description: >-
      Home Assistant local username enabled/revoked for support access (for example `Nodalia`).
      It should be a dedicated support user and not an owner account.
  support_target_url:
    name: Legacy target URL (external apps)
    description: >-
      Optional compatibility value for external apps.
      It is not used in the normal Nodalia support flow.
  support_tunnel_ttl_minutes:
    name: Support access TTL (minutes)
    description: >-
      Auto-expire time for temporary support access.
      After this duration, access is revoked automatically and an audit
      event is recorded.
network:
  41641/udp: >-
    UDP port to listen on for WireGuard and peer-to-peer traffic.
    When not set, an automatically selected port is used by default.
